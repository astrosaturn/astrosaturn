# 🌌 Eric Poroznik

Hi there! My name is Eric, a computer science student from Ontario, Canada. I’m passionate about exploring the depths of technology, from high-level applications to low-level systems. As a full-stack developer, I enjoy both front-end and back-end development, I have a particular affinity for low-level languages and systems programming.
