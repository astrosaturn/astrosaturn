# Hello! My name is Eric, or you can call me Saturn
I'm a computer science student from Ontario, Canada. I’m passionate about building all kinds of technology from large web applications to XR game development. 

I am currently in my internship in the CDA team in Kingston at the Department of National Defence. Right now I'm working on a full-stack Vue/Nuxt application for Canadian Armed Forces members!

I have worked on a variety of different projects including web development, game development, chat bots, user management systems, shaders/lighting systems, and physics systems. 

I have also worked on projects linking software to external hardware like VR Haptic Suits (ARAIG, bHaptics) and Arduino.
